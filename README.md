# Poker Hand Evaluator using Python - Assessment for RSAWeb

Based on the instructions for completing this assessment for the Poker hand evaluator, I have referred to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands
for the game instructions as well as the different type of ranks and suits in Poker.
i have also reffered to https://www.cardplayer.com/rules-of-poker/hand-rankings for rank descriptions. 


The highest ranked hand type is
*Royal Flush* and the lowest is *High Card*


i have written 2 test scripts called "PokerTest.py" and "FinalCompletedTest" while working on the main project "PokerAssessmentPython.py". The first test initializes and stores poker hand values, Hand ranks and also the type of pair or wins to evaulate hand ranks.


The final completed test checks tests all cases and pairs for the poker hand evaluator game.
i have made this game pretty easy to use which runs on any Windows, Linux or android device.

My end goal is to complete the ranking algorithm to correctly identify all
ranks, and be confident the tests cover all edge cases.


## Instructions

1. Clone or download this repository,
or download from https://github.com/LorenzoDamon/Python3_pokerGame.

(Extract and unzip file to a pc location)

2. Choose an editor/IDE. - you can use any Python interpretor, online editor or command line prompt, however VSCode is recommended for its
simplicity

3. If using VSCode or VB.Net, import the main file called "PokerAssessmentPython.py" , to run the active main Python file, click the Run Python File in Terminal play button in the top-right side of the editor.

or alternatively, you can open command line prompt and type "Python FilePath name" eg Python Documents/PokerPythonAssessment.py (make sure you know where you saved the python file after unzipping file. main file is important and can run Without tests files)


Note: All you need to run this program is the main file called "PokerAssessmentPython.py". all other files which are tests scripts and json files are linked to the main program but can run successfully without debugging.

 
##' Further Testing

For the purposes of exhaustive testing, all 2,598,960 possible combinations of
cards have been ranked and stored in a gzipped JSON file.


You should see `All tests passing!` - if not, you'll see the first failed assertion.

## Extension and game play

once the program runs, type in a number between 1 - 5 to start game play.)

Done! the results will show the hand or pair that wins.


#Things to try 
Once you have finished ranking or playing  hands, try something else:

- Try playing the same number or hand twice to see the algorithm change. 

- Compare two hands - which hand wins?

This program can be extended and the code is re usable for further development.

Hope you enjoy this game!
